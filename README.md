Heart Disease Prediction System

This project is a Heart Disease Prediction System developed using machine learning and data analysis techniques. It aims to assist in the early detection of heart-related conditions by analyzing patient health data and predicting the likelihood of heart disease.

Features

- Predicts the risk of heart disease based on medical input data
- Implements popular machine learning models for classification
- Performs data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Supports early intervention by providing decision support

Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for ML models)

Models Applied

- Logistic Regression

Dataset

The system uses a public heart disease dataset (e.g., from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease)) containing features such as:

- Age
- Cholesterol
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Maximum Heart Rate
- Chest Pain Type
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- and others.
  
Goal

To support medical professionals and researchers by providing a quick and interpretable prediction system that can be used as a supplementary diagnostic tool.
